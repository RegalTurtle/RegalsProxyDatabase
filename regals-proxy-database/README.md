Regal's Proxy Database is a personal Magic proxy archive built with Next.js, Scryfall, Cloudflare R2, and MongoDB.

## Environment

Create or edit `.env` in the project root:

```env
# Cloudflare R2
R2_ACCOUNT_ID=
R2_ACCESS_KEY_ID=
R2_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY=
R2_BUCKET=
R2_PUBLIC_URL=

# MongoDB
MONGODB_URI=
MONGODB_DB=regals-proxy-database
MONGODB_PROXIES_COLLECTION=proxies
```

`.env` is ignored by Git so secrets stay local.

Proxy images are uploaded to Cloudflare R2 through `/api/proxies/upload`.
Proxy records are stored in MongoDB through `/api/proxies`.

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
# or
bun dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `app/page.tsx`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

This project uses [`next/font`](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/building-your-application/optimizing/fonts) to automatically optimize and load [Geist](https://vercel.com/font), a new font family for Vercel.
